'''
1. All name variables and methods are public by default in Python

2. Protected method we can define By prefixing the name of your variable or method with a single underscore.
 Protected mean you’re telling others “don’t touch this, unless you’re a subclass”

3. private variable we can define By prefixing the name of your method with a double underscore,
4. By declaring your data member private you mean, that nobody should be able to access it from outside the class.
